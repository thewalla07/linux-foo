When testing the system, we tried to emulate an environment where multiple users might be using the system. We started a new system and added a few users in new terminals on the same desktop. We had each user create multiple folder types with varying permissions, and then checked with the other users to ensure that permissions were restricting/allowing access where appropriate.

We created a shared folder, and changed the permissions on it over time to see the effects it had on different users and different groups. Using this folder we also sent a protected file to the system which was encrypted for only two users, but was readable (ie downloadable) by everyone. This helped us to test the encryption section of the software. We tried deleting various files with different users to make sure no permissions could be evaded.
